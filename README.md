## Weather Dashboard

As a user, I can visit this application to view wheather report of selected cities. I can get the following details:
- get priviously saved weather details of the cities I have searched. It uses localStorage behind the keep record of cities.
- Used [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data.
- I can get forecast of next 5 days. Sample API used http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q=santa+clara&appid=80e91e7834cea9b00e1d1d34b02e2b23
- I can see the UV index of the city selected. It shows red if UV index is greater than 6 else it shows green. The color coding is done to understand the quality of air. 
- Multiple cities can be searched.
